# Art150 | Assignment #1 - Drawing Machine

Hello! Welcome!

This is an assignment that I created for Art 150: Intro to New Media at UIC.

This is a very simple program that spawns multiple colorful circles and diamonds in the center and they bounce around the entire place.

*Note: You can drag the mouse on the screen to spawn boxes around the cursor! They'll also bounce around but have a nifty feature of 
"disappearing." Really, they slowly change the overall color to black and match the color of the background which makes it seem like they disappear.
